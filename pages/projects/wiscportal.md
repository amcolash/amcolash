During the end of the fall semester and all of spring semester, I was employed by the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). As a web developer, I was in charge of a new system to disseminate data for both public health officials as well as the common public. In the course of this position, I took a concept and transformed it into a fully functioning and mobile responsive HTML5 website. In addition to being responsive to different screen sizes using Bottstrap, the page is fully touch capable and dynamically draws charts and graphs using HighCharts.
