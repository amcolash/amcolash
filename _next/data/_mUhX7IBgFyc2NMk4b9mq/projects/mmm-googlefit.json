{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"MMM-GoogleFit","slug":"mmm-googlefit","content":"<p>MMM-GoogleFit is a personal project that I made for my MagicMirror (see link for more info). I developed this module using the GoogleFit API, HighCharts, node and the MagicMirror2 framework. This module shows distance walked (colored rings) and optionally shows recent weights saved to Google Fit. My favorite part of this project is the simple authentication flow which allows a user to log into google fit without supplying any credentials in the configuration file.</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/amcolash/MMM-GoogleFit"},{"_target":null,"title":"MagicMirror","url":"https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/MMM-GoogleFit3.jpg","/assets/img/projects/MMM-GoogleFit.jpg","/assets/img/projects/MMM-GoogleFit2.jpg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
