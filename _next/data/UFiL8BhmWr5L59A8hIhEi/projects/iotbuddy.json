Not knowing quite what to do with it, I decided to make a simple application for my Pebble Time smartwatch. This smartwatch app then interfaced with the popular web service IFTTT. This service lets you link different other web services, such as Twitter, Facebook, Gmail or in my case a smart outlet strip together. IoTBuddy allows users to trigger an IFTTT event from anywhere in the world without needing to use a phone or web browser.</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/amcolash/IoT-Buddy"},{"_target":null,"title":"Pebble App Store","url":"https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/568f550d05f633c62800003d"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/IoTBuddy.png"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
