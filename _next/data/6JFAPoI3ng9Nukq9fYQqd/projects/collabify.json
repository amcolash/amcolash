{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"Collabify","slug":"collabify","content":"<p>For my last semester of school at the University of Wisconsin Madison, I enrolled in a software engineering course. In this class, we worked in groups and had the task of developing a new piece of software. Our team decided on making an Android app with a Python backend that would allow for the creation of dynamic Spotify playlists that could be collaborated and voted upon - the ultimate party playlist. In addition to a lot of code from Github, there is also a link to some of the documentation and presentation that we have from the final project.</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/Collabify"},{"_target":null,"title":"Project Presentation","url":"/assets/documents/Collabify_Presentation.pdf"},{"_target":null,"title":"Project Manual","url":"/assets/documents/Collabify_Manual.pdf"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/Collabify.jpg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
