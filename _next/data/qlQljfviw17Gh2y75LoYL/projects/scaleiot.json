{"pageProps":{"project":{"title":"ScaleIoT","slug":"scaleiot","content":"<p>ScaleIoT is another project from my large collection of IoT (Internet of Things) projects. In this project, I decided to make a smart scale that would record the weight of a user that stepped onto the scale and then display statistics on the users' weight over time on a web page. This project uses a raspberry pi and a webcam, along with a python-based OpenCV image processing component. I learned a lot about OpenCV and image processing through the course of this project and it is one of my most useful projects to date_range!</p>\n","links":[{"_target":null,"title":"Github","url":"https://github.com/amcolash/ScaleIoT"}],"images":["/assets/img/projects/ScaleIoT.gif","/assets/img/projects/ScaleIoT.jpg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
