      Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). As a web developer, I was in charge of a new system to disseminate data for both
      public health officials as well as the common public. In the course of this position, I took a concept and
      transformed it into a fully functioning and mobile responsive HTML5 website. In addition to being responsive to
      different screen sizes using Bottstrap, the page is fully touch capable and dynamically draws charts and graphs
      using HighCharts."

      MadHacks. This hackathon was very open and had many different types of possibilities available. Since Pebble was a
      sponsor at the event and had some staff on hand, our group decided to make a Pebble watch application that could
      control Spotify and display album artwork on your wrist from another device. This app, while not polished and not
      completely finished was a proof of concept and helped to open the road for me to continue developing other Pebble
      app projects. Our group won the \"Best Pebble Hack\" award, which made the experience even more rewarding!"
