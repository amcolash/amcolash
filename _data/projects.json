We have been working hard to build tools for our artists so that they can build dynamic parallax environments, author visual effects and make custom paths for projectiles to travel on. This tooling will provide artists with an experience similar to unity, while allowing us to use our game engine of choice - libgdx."

This includes adding in new functionality into the particle system engine, combat engine and external content delivery system. Additionally, I also worked on creating tooling for VFX artists to preview their effects on heroes in a 1:1 replica of real combat in-game."

I was interested in learning about the service Firebase for my next side project. I was particularly interested in catching up on my Angular skills (the last time I had used it was in 2014). The project taught me about not only Angular but also about the Ionic and Corvoda frameworks which were the stars of this project."

I wrote the code for the site and later one of the other developers started to implement his own unique software into my code. I wrote the game with Firebase and Ionic.

Since Pebble was a sponsor at the event and had some staff on hand, our group decided to make a Pebble watch application that could control Spotify and display album artwork on your wrist from another device. This app, while not polished and not completely finished was a proof of concept and helped to open the road for me to continue developing other Pebble app projects. Our group won the \"Best Pebble Hack\" award, which made the experience even more rewarding!"
