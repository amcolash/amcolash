It is a pretty slick piece of tech with a completely custom-built PCB and case. A comprable DIY raspberry pi zero build costs about the same but with a single core instead of the RetroStone's quad core H3 processor. Emulating N64 and PS1 is a breeze and works smoothly for almost all but the most demanding games out there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I had such a cool piece of tech to work on, it was time to get some games on it. It has a built in ethernet port so I ssh'ed in and went to town. Later that night I realized I had forgotten Zelda: Links Awakening a game I really loved playing as a kid had been missed when I copied some games I owned over. It would have been great to do it without powering off and taking out the SD and without needing cables. Luckily I had a $3 wifi dongle sitting around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Issue\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did I know that getting wifi working on this little device would be quite a headache (and it still isn't fully working properly).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started by figuring out what wifi dongle I had. It turns out I had a variant of the 8812EU chip, which \u003cem\u003eSHOULD\u003c/em\u003e be supported out of the box on most linux kernels going back some time. Of course, plug and play never quite seems to work on any SBC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started by installing headers for my kernel (3.4.113-sun8i a very old kernel at the time of writing) and trying to compile various versions of drivers I found for the 8812EU. These efforts didn't get me too far and after fighting with trying to get things working I threw in the towel on this front. It was a lot of work and there must be support already since it looked like the usb device was being picked up by \u003ccode\u003elsusb\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I decided to read through the logs from \u003ccode\u003edmesg\u003c/code\u003e and here things got more interesting. Here is what happened after I plugged the device in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-accesslog\"\u003e[  843.112752] ehci_irq: highspeed device connect\n[  843.380223] usb 3-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using sunxi-ehci\n[  843.532354] usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0bda, idProduct=8179\n[  843.532394] usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\n[  843.532424] usb 3-1: Product: 802.11n WLAN NIC\n[  843.532447] usb 3-1: Manufacturer: Realtek\n[  843.599057] RTL871X: module init start\n[  843.599093] RTL871X: rtl8188eu v4.3.0.6_12167.20140828\n[  843.599115] RTL871X: build time: Feb  9 2019 20:17:07\n[  843.599146] ERR: script_get_item wifi_usbc_id failed\n[  843.599166] RTL871X: module init ret=-1\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotice the 2nd last line has the error \u003ccode\u003eERR: script_get_item wifi_usbc_id failed\u003c/code\u003e. A quick stop at google and I started finding interesting results on the web. It looks like there is an improperly configured setup in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.retrorangepi.org/\"\u003eRetrOrangePi\u003c/a\u003e (similar to RetroPie but for OrangePi boards) image that I had flashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Fix\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fix is actually pretty simple to work through. You just have to modify the \u003ccode\u003e.fex\u003c/code\u003e configuration that is loaded on the boot of \u003ca href=\"https://www.armbian.com/\"\u003earmbian\u003c/a\u003e (the underlying OS used with allwinner chips and RetrOrangePi).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStart the armbian configuration utility using the command \u003ccode\u003esudo armbian-config\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelect system from the menu, then choose Fexedit from the submenu. This will open a text editor with the boot configuration of the device. Around 75% of the way through the file for me, there was a chunk that started with \u003ccode\u003e[wifi_para]\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed the line \u003ccode\u003ewifi_usbc_id =\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003ewifi_usbc_id = 1\u003c/code\u003e based off of a post \u003ca href=\"http://4pda.ru/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t750921-1740.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and magically after a reboot the network device now showed up with \u003ccode\u003esudo ifconfig\u003c/code\u003e. As an odd side effect, it seems that 2 network devices showed up: \u003ccode\u003ewlan1\u003c/code\u003e as well as \u003ccode\u003ewlan3\u003c/code\u003e. I am not sure why both are there, but it seems that it has something to do with \u003ccode\u003enetwork-manager\u003c/code\u003e being installed. After uninstalling, one of the devices disappeared, but there were still quirks so I didn't mention that part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final step was to configure wifi on the device. This is pretty simple using the built in command \u003ccode\u003esudo nmtui-connect\u003c/code\u003e. I connected to wifi with \u003ccode\u003ewlan3\u003c/code\u003e since this seemed to work out better than \u003ccode\u003ewlan1\u003c/code\u003e. After connected to wifi things seemed to be working - that is until I tried to ssh over wifi when I unplugged the ethernet cable while it was turned on. For some reason or another, it seems that having both network interfaces enabled at the same time confuses something (though I have never had an issue on other similar linux devices). My solution to this problem is to choose a method of connection when the device is off and then to only switch from wifi/ethernet after a reboot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE 06/30/2019\u003c/strong\u003e:\nI ended up editing up \u003ccode\u003e/etc/network/interfaces\u003c/code\u003e to try and get things working better. I was able to turn off power management on the wifi device which really helped the reliability of the connection. (Just uncommented from the existing file)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWrapping Up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily things were not too complicated in the end to get working, but what a pain that was. Working with newer versions of linux kernels I would assume would solve a lot of the issues seen here - someday I hope I can get a mainline kernel onto this thing to make things work out of the box. Until then, I have this workaround which works well enough for a once in a while wifi connection!\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["2019","2019-06-27-wifi-on-retrostone"]},"buildId":"hkNhA9fernPYl0Q26f-4d","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-e893e522365b6e0e5fa4.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-3c855b485160cefc9d3d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-6d367796461d937cee5e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.b47c716380b27eb7b204.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/47a05d1047ddd1f7300d5df324c2af73b7ca5d68.17dbf6c0bf9f512baec3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/0091a7db1bec141872318e71233f7f833a8550ed.cd53116c8dd30b442411.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/4b58f52b29e540464fd1347ed85f5126d9ee4864.9c82370463ac9940b5ee.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-8cb4004d4626542f5e60.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/faa552d195daf7240ff6c6e151b90b359a413e98.471e1c7808f3f37a6ecd.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/faa552d195daf7240ff6c6e151b90b359a413e98_CSS.a83a6a4548b93404854d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/%5B...slug%5D-1babac90ad590a6f9896.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hkNhA9fernPYl0Q26f-4d/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/hkNhA9fernPYl0Q26f-4d/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
