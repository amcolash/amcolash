For my internship at Liberty Mutual, I worked on a mobile responsive website/webapp that acted as a pre-approval for the various app stores. It allowed for adding content to a ticket, which would then be approved by various managers before actually being allowed into the app stores. This was a big upgrade from the email chains which were used prior to this.
