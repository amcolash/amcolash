For a gift, I had recieved an internet enabled outlet strip. Not knowing quite what to do with it, I decided to make a simple application for my Pebble Time smartwatch. This smartwatch app then interfaced with the popular web service <a href='http://ifttt.com'>IFTTT</a>. This service lets you link different other web services, such as Twitter, Facebook, Gmail or in my case a smart outlet strip together. IoTBuddy allows users to trigger an IFTTT event from anywhere in the world without needing to use a phone or web browser.
