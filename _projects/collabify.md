For my last semester of school at the University of Wisconsin Madison, I enrolled in a software engineering course. In this class, we worked in groups and had the task of developing a new piece of software. Our team decided on making an Android app with a Python backend that would allow for the creation of dynamic Spotify playlists that could be collaborated and voted upon - the ultimate party playlist. In addition to a lot of code from Github, there is also a link to some of the documentation and presentation that we have from the final project.
