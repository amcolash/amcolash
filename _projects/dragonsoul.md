From the summer of 2015 through September 2016, I worked on developing and implementing new content into the mobile role playing game - DragonSoul by PerBlue. The game focuses on collecting heroes to fight against the forces of evil. On the technical side of things, I have worked on implementing unique combat logic, content (new heroes, npcs and game modes) and developing tooling for both our art team and quality assurance team.
